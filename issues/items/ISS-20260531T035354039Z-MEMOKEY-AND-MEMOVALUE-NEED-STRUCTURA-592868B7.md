# ISS-20260531T035354039Z-MEMOKEY-AND-MEMOVALUE-NEED-STRUCTURA-592868B7: MemoKey and MemoValue need structural purity rules

## 概要

Phase 1 memo_call can use Copy-like key/value types, but TypeCtx::is_copy alone is too broad because function values, references, raw pointers, owner tokens, public mutable state, and external handles must not become MemoKey or MemoValue.

## 問題

Phase 1 memo_call can use Copy-like key/value types, but TypeCtx::is_copy alone is too broad because function values, references, raw pointers, owner tokens, public mutable state, and external handles must not become MemoKey or MemoValue.

## 影響

If MemoKey or MemoValue is treated as a simple Copy alias, memo_call can cache values whose identity or behavior is externally observable, breaking the Pure contract.

## 修正方針

Define structural MemoKey and MemoValue rules that require pure Eq/Hash/Clone/Drop where applicable and explicitly reject function values, references, raw pointers, owner tokens, public mutable state, external resources, unknown effect values, and non-Copy/Drop values in Phase 1.

## 検証

Accepted tests should cover primitive scalar/unit/structural Copy values; rejected tests should cover function keys, impure Eq/Hash/Clone/Drop, references, raw pointers, owner tokens, mutable/public state, external handles, and non-Copy values.
