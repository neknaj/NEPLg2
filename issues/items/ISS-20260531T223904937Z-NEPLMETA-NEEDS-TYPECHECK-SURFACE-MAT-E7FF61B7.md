# ISS-20260531T223904937Z-NEPLMETA-NEEDS-TYPECHECK-SURFACE-MAT-E7FF61B7: .neplmeta needs typecheck surface materializer

## 概要

Even with a structured .neplmeta payload, the compiler needs a safe way to project artifact-owned public surfaces into the current compile session's fresh TypeCtx, Env, trait table, impl table, and diagnostic origin.

## 対象

## 問題

Even with a structured .neplmeta payload, the compiler needs a safe way to project artifact-owned public surfaces into the current compile session's fresh TypeCtx, Env, trait table, impl table, and diagnostic origin.

## 影響

Using .neplmeta directly or by parsing stable text would either be unsafe or too slow, and dependency body-skip would remain blocked.

## 修正方針

Introduce a fail-closed materializer that converts structured public surfaces into current-session TypeId/Env entries and import visibility, with diagnostics anchored to import directives rather than artifact spans.

## 検証

Check-only tests should use .neplmeta-derived surfaces for stdlib/prelude/import modules and reject stale or incomplete artifacts; alias, reexport, noshadow, trait impl lookup, and public signature edit invalidation must be covered.
